## Description 

Solution of interview task

After running the app, in the sidebar there are 4 options, where the 'Account Details' and 'Customer Details' are related to the first task, 'Shared button' to the third and fourth and 'Form', which is related to the third task.
This solution covers the specs of the assignment, as described.

## Installatio

### Task 1-3
* Run `npm install` inside the folder containing the `package.json`
* Run `ng serve` 
* If after the application has been build no new browser has been opened, please open one and navigate to `localhost:4200`
 
### Task 4
* Run `npm install` inside the folder containing the `package.json` (if this is already done in the process of testing task 1-3, please skip)
* Rin `ng test` inside the projects root directory


## Authors note

The interesting things in the solution are related to the third task, where a button is created in the same manner as if it is prepared to be exposed to a library, that is why the `ViewEncapsulation.None` is used.
